Weather Station Project Plan 
1. Objective

Build an ESP32-based weather station that measures:

Temperature

Humidity

Wind Speed

Wind Direction

Displays the data on an SH1107 OLED and uploads it to ThingSpeak cloud.

2. Hardware Components

ESP32 DevKit V1

DHT22 sensor (temp/humidity)

Potentiometer (simulated wind speed)

Rotary encoder (wind direction)

SH1107 OLED display

WiFi (Wokwi-GUEST)

3. Wiring Summary
Component	ESP32 Pin
DHT22 Data	GPIO 23
Potentiometer	ADC pin GPIO 34
Encoder CLK	GPIO 18
Encoder DT	GPIO 19
OLED SDA	GPIO 21
OLED SCL	GPIO 22
All VCC → 3.3V, all GND → GND	
4. System Behavior

Read sensors:

DHT22 → temperature & humidity

Potentiometer → wind speed

Encoder → wind direction (N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW)

Display values on OLED.

Send data to ThingSpeak every 20 seconds:

field1 = temperature

field2 = humidity

field3 = wind speed

field4 = wind direction index

Show upload status in Serial Monitor.

5. Deliverables

Working Wokwi simulation

ESP32 code

ThingSpeak channel with graphs
